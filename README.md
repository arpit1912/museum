we are working with this **delhi based museum website** <http://www.nationalmuseumindia.gov.in/prodCollections.asp?pid=80&id=8&lk=dp8> 

* bs.py - uses beautiful soup to scrape delhi website
* bs2.py - uses beautiful soup and prints out the entire html page using html5lib parser from the **IITTP website** <http://gcu.iittp.ac.in/home>
* data.csv - has all the data scraped from the delhi based museum website
* debug.log - not so necessary It is just a log file
